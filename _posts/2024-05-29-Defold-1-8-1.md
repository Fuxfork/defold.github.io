# Defold 1.8.1

Defold 1.8.1 includes new engine features like error handling for file writes, options for disabling LiveUpdate auto-mounting, and support for Lua transpilers, new and improved camera component and API, as well as numerous bug fixes related to meshes, sprites, fonts, HTTP requests, and editor UI issues.

We'd like to highlight the **initial support for Lua transpilers** in the build pipeline (both editor and bob). The first language that can be used to try the transpiler feature is [**Teal**](https://github.com/teal-language/tl) â€” a typed dialect of Lua. You will need to add [teal extension](https://github.com/defold/extension-teal) to the dependencies to try it out. The support is currently limited to transpilation only and excludes automatic extern generation for Defold's Lua APIs. This means it is more useful for writing type-safe standalone logic than interacting with Defold runtime, though teal allows writing necessary externs yourself.

The first iteration of an improved camera component has been added in this version of Defold. The camera API is now available in all scripts (including render scripts and gui scripts) via the `camera` namespace, and contain new functionality to bind a camera to the renderer instead of passing explicit view and projection matrices to it.

## Engine
__NEW__: ([#8870](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8870)) __Add error reason for fwrite in sys.save__ 
Fixed an issue where sys.save doesn't output the reason why it couldn't write to a file.

__NEW__: ([#8857](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8857)) __Add a new option in `game.project`: `liveupdate.mount_on_start`, which disables auto-mounts at the start of the game.__ 
In some cases, it might be useful to fully control from the code what exactly needs to be mounted instead of using auto-mount at the start of the application. Now, this is possible to do using the `liveupdate.mount_on_start` checkbox in `game.project`.

__NEW__: ([#8868](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8868)) __Camera component refactor + improved camera module__ 
The camera script module and the camera component has been updated:

* The camera component will automatically acquire focus when it is created. There is no more need to send the "acquire_camera_focus" message to the component. To disable the camera, use go.set("#camera", "disable") instead.

`NOTE:
This is a subtle change in behaviour. Previously you had to send a "acquire_camera_focus" message to the component for a camera to be updated. With the new code path, all cameras will be enabled and updated automatically until you actively send an "unacquire_camera_focus" message. Since the old behaviour was so cumbersome to work with, we **do not consider this as a breaking change** - instead we consider it to be a bugfix or simply as a workflow improvement.`

* All scripts can now access the `camera` namespace. There are new functions in the module that can now be used:
```lua
-- returns a list of all currently available cameras. each entry in the table is a camera URL (see msg.url)
local all_cameras = camera.get_cameras()
-- get/set properties. note that not all properties can be set
camera.get_projection(camera_url) -- read-only
camera.get_view(camera_url)-- read-only
camera.get_aspect_ratio(camera_url)
camera.set_aspect_ratio(camera_url)
camera.get_fov(camera_url)
camera.set_fov(camera_url)
camera.get_near_z(camera_url)
camera.set_near_z(camera_url)
camera.get_far_z(camera_url)
camera.set_far_z(camera_url)
camera.get_orthographic_zoom(camera_url)
camera.set_orthographic_zoom(camera_url)
```

* The render API has a new function `render.set_camera(camera_url, [options])` - this can be used in a render script to automatically use the view and projection matrices from the camera in the next draw call:
```lua
-- a typical camera based render loop can now look like this
for k,v in pairs(camera.get_cameras()) do
    -- note that the view and projection matrices previously set up
    -- using render.set_view and render.set_projection will be wiped by this call
    -- the 'use_frustum' option will use the cameras view projection matrix for frustum culling
    -- this will take precedence over any frustum passed in to the render.draw function
    render.set_camera(v, { use_frustum = true })
    -- set other drawing states
    render.draw(pred_scene)
end
-- unbind the camera for custom rendering
render.set_camera()
render.set_view(...)
render.set_projection(...)
render.draw(pred_gui)
```

The next iteration of improving the camera component involves:
* adding a viewport property to the camera that will automatically be set when calling render.set_camera
* adding coordinate system conversion functions (screen->world, world->screen, project/unproject and so on)

__FIX__: ([#8882](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8882)) __Support building a mesh without any samplers assigned__ 
Bob can now bundle projects with meshes that have no textures specified.

__FIX__: ([#8845](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8845)) __Reset buttons state when focus lost.__ 


__FIX__: ([#8819](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8819)) __Make sure go.get_world_position() returns the correct value when called from the init() function.__ 
Fixed an issue where objects in deep hierarchies returned the wrong value for `go.get_world_position()` when called from `init()`.

__FIX__: ([#8844](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8844)) __Fixed canvas flickering in the HTML5 bundle when the window is being resized.__ 
Fixed an issue where the game's canvas flickers black (a background color) when resizing the browser window.

__FIX__: ([#8853](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8853)) __Support using no color when writing custom vertex attribute for sprites__ 
Fixed an issue where a sprite was using a material with a "color" semantic type that didn't get written to the vertex buffer.

__FIX__: ([#8864](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8864)) __Added missing lua_source_ddf.proto to dmSDK__ 


__FIX__: ([#8880](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8880)) __Fixed crash when sprite material uses N samplers but shaders uses less than N samplers.__ 


__FIX__: ([#8886](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8886)) __Fixed an issue where font metrics were incorrect for monospaced fonts.__ 
Monospaced fonts should always use the fixed Advance Width for each symbol as its width, instead of the glyph's real width.

__FIX__: ([#8893](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8893)) __Engine crashes when producing secondary uv sets__ 


__FIX__: ([#8906](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8906)) __Handle 'path' option in http.request for html5 implementation.__ 
Add 'path' parameter handling for html5 implementation in `http.request` function.

__FIX__: ([#8879](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8879)) __[Web] Fix sound play while AudioContext is suspended__ 



## Editor
__NEW__: ([#8284](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/8284)) __Use Teal as a typed Lua alternative__ 
Follow-up prototyping task to https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6398

__NEW__: ([#8843](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8843)) __Add ogg validation in the editor__ 


__FIX__: ([#8837](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8837)) __Allow setting Image property when multi-selecting__ 


__FIX__: ([#8839](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8839)) __Limit the number of rendered errors__ 


__FIX__: ([#8883](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8883)) __Changing from a material with an overridden vertex attribute causes an assert__ 
Fixed an issue where a component has an overridden vertex attribute and the user changes the material where the attribute doesn't exist. In this case the editor triggers an assert which leaves the editor in a bad state.
