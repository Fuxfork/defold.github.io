## Engine
__NEW__: ([#9298](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9298)) __`Bob.jar` builds only files from the dependency tree__ 
This fix introduces the building of a dependency tree before the bundling step for `Bob.jar`—the building and bundling tool for Defold. This helps avoid building all the files in the project folder, as was previously the case. Instead, it builds only the files referenced in the tree that starts from `game.project`.

__NEW__: ([#9300](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9300)) __Added engine.max_time_step config value__ 
In case the engine timestep grows too large, it will be capped against this max value (default is 0.5 seconds)

__NEW__: ([#9315](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9315)) __Add documentation for `report_progress ` in `http.request`__ 


__NEW__: ([#9367](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9367)) __Added b2d.get_angular_damping()/b2d.set_angular_damping()__ 
The two functions had accidentally been left out of the api.

__NEW__: ([#9214](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9214)) __Add 'types' script module for checking Defold userdata types.__ 
Changes added new Lua module '**types**' which contains utility function to check Defold userdata type like vector, vector3, matrix, quaternion, etc. Module can be excluded via AppManifest.

Usage example:
```lua
    local url = msg.url("main_collection", "/hero", "right_hand")
    print(types.is_url(url)) ----> true

    local long_vector = vmath.vector({ 10, 14, 19, -20, -11, -2, 132 })
    print(types.is_vector(long_vector)) --------> true

    local non_empty_vector3 = vmath.vector3(13, 14.5, -7)
    print(types.is_vector3(non_empty_vector3)) ------> true

    local non_empty_matrix = vmath.matrix4_translation(non_empty_vector3)
    print(types.is_matrix4(non_empty_matrix)) -----> true

    local non_empty_quat = vmath.quat(1, 2, 3, 4)
    print(types.is_quat(non_empty_quat)) ------> true

    local test_hash = hash("some_foo_text")
    print(types.is_hash(test_hash))  --- ---> true

    print(not types.is_vector(non_empty_vector3))   ------> false
    print(not types.is_vector(nil))   ------> false
    print(not types.is_vector3(non_empty_matrix))   ------> false
    print(not types.is_quat(non_empty_vector3))   ------> false
    print(not types.is_url(long_vector))   ------> false
    print(not types.is_matrix4(test_hash))   ------> false
```

__FIX__: ([#9269](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9269)) __Support render.enable_material with material(s) that use custom vertex attributes__ 
Components didn't produce custom vertex attributes when a "context material" is set using render.enable_material(..) together with a material that has custom vertex attributes.

__FIX__: ([#9274](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9274)) __Support turning vsync off for Vulkan__ 
Vulkan can now turn vsync off by setting the [swap interval](https://defold.com/manuals/project-settings/#swap-interval) of the game.project file to zero. Note that there is no actual concept of swap intervals built-in by Vulkan, hence this value simply turns vsync on or off. To fully support swap intervals other than these values, we need to manually wait for vblanks, which is currently not planned.

__FIX__: ([#9301](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9301)) __Added support for display.update_frequency for headless builds__ 
This allows for control of the headless builds where no graphics backend is present.
Can be turned off using the setting `display.update_frequency = 0`

Fixes: https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/8029

__FIX__: ([#9330](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9330)) __Detect circular dependencies during the build process in Bob__ 
Before this fix, it was possible to bundle a project with circular dependencies, which would result in a runtime crash. Now, Bob detects such cases and reports them during the build process:

```
Circular dependency detected:
main.lua class com.dynamo.bob.pipeline.ScriptBuilders$LuaScriptBuilder
-> first.lua class com.dynamo.bob.pipeline.ScriptBuilders$LuaScriptBuilder (Circular Point)
second.lua class com.dynamo.bob.pipeline.ScriptBuilders$LuaScriptBuilder
third.lua class com.dynamo.bob.pipeline.ScriptBuilders$LuaScriptBuilder
-> first.lua class com.dynamo.bob.pipeline.ScriptBuilders$LuaScriptBuilder (Circular Point)'
```

__FIX__: ([#9347](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9347)) __Added fix for asynchronous raycast messages__ 
This fixes a rare crash where lingering raycast messages were handled the exact frame when the collection was freed.

__FIX__: ([#9349](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9349)) __Optimized the sprite component size__ 
The size is now 256 bytes (previously 272).
Example with 896 sprites was 288kb and became 256kb.

__FIX__: ([#9378](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9378)) __Make the atlas output `*.a.texturec` more deterministic__ 
Fixes the issue where changing the order of images in an atlas without altering any content results in a different `*.a.texturesetc` file.

__FIX__: ([#9368](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9368)) __Rebuilt spirv tools for macos 10.15__ 
This fixes an issue on macOS 10 or 11, where shaders weren't built properly.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#9307](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9307)) __Decorate editor build exceptions with error source__ 
Exceptions thrown from building the project in the editor will now contain information about the source of the error for diagnostic purposes.

__NEW__: ([#9353](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9353)) __Notify if a GameObject/Component Id or Collection Name contains a space at the beginning or end.__ 
It may be hard to notice if a GameObject or component ID contains a space symbol at the beginning or end. With this fix, a warning will be shown in the editor.

__NEW__: ([#9355](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9355)) __Use naming for bundle folders based on the bundle architecture when bundling from the editor.__ 
The editor will create a folder based on the architecture selected in the bundle dialog. For example, for macOS:
- `x86_64-macos`
- `arm64-macos`
- `universal-macos` (if both architectures are selected)

__FIX__: ([#9293](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9293)) __Fix dialog behavior on Linux__ 


__FIX__: ([#9277](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9277)) __Fix various issues with slice9 and gui pivots__ 
* The slice-9 setting will now be correctly visualized in the editor viewport in all scenarios.
* Gui pivot offsets are now correctly visualized in the editor viewport in all scenarios.
* You can no longer select "Polygons" as a Sprite Trim Mode for an atlas image, which would previously throw an exception.


__FIX__: ([#9317](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9317)) __Fix missing animation preview overlay in atlas views__ 
The animation preview overlay is now visible again in atlas views.

__FIX__: ([#9316](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9316)) __Ensure build resource paths for embedded resources always reflect their contents__ 
Referencing a `.wav` or `.ogg` file directly as a component from a game object embedded in a collection no longer throws an exception when building the project.

__FIX__: ([#9327](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9327)) __Correctly visualize trimmed sprites with flipped animations__ 
The editor now correctly renders sprites and GUI nodes with flipped animations in the scene view.

__FIX__: ([#9356](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9356)) __Remove the GUI scene itself from the GUI template picking dialog__ 
Picking the GUI as a template for itself results in the editor freezing. This fix hides the GUI scene from the GUI template picking dialog.
