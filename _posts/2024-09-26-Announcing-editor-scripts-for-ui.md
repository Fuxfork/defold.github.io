We are excited to announce our first technical preview of an editor scripting API for creating interactive UI elements in the editor!

To learn more, check out [the new manual](https://defold.com/manuals/editor-scripts-ui/) that explains how to create interactive dialogs using editor scripts. Also, now that the editor API has grown quite a bit, we added the [editor API reference](https://defold.com/ref/alpha/editor/).

Try it out and tell us what you think!
