# Defold 1.9.0 

Defold version 1.9.0 is now available as a stable release. Please read on for technical notes and a full list of changes. Enjoy!

## Migration to glfw3 for macOS
This version of Defold will use glfw3 for macOS. This is the first step in an effort to move all platforms from glfw2 to glfw3. Migrating to glfw3 will eventually solve a lot of platform specific problems related to window management, application lifecycle, input management etc but there is a risk that problems are discovered along the way. One such problem that was discovered late in the beta for 1.9.0 was that the update frequency on macOS is 120hz despite vsync being enabled (https://forum.defold.com/t/defold-1-9-0-beta/77189/13?u=britzl).

## Compute program support
We have also released general compute program support as a technical preview. Please refer to the Compute Program manual to learn more: https://defold.com/manuals/compute/

# Lua language server integration
It is also worth pointing out that the Lua language server is now fully integrated with the editor. If you previously used the LSP as an extension, please make sure to remove it from your project dependencies. Some users have reported that linting sometimes takes a long time and slows down builds. You can disable lint on build from the editor preferences.

## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#7889](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7889)) __Added initial C support to configfile.h, extension.h and resource.h__ 
We've added some first pure C api headers to our `dmSDK`: `configfile.h`, `extension.h` and `resource.h`.
This is a step in our current effort to add C# support to our engine.

:warning:
The old C++ api's should be mostly intact, however we did change passing some structs as pointers (previously passed as references).

Also, due to limitations of typedef'ing enums, we generate some C++ enums from the C equivalents. Casting between them is safe.

While stricly a breaking change for extension developers, we don't anticipate many developers having to do any changes to their extensions.

## New extension releases:

We have updated some extensions that use the new api's:

https://github.com/defold/extension-spine/releases/tag/3.3.0
https://github.com/britzl/defold-screenshot/releases/tag/1.11.0
https://github.com/britzl/extension-imgui/releases/tag/2.2.0
https://github.com/britzl/defold-sharing/releases/tag/4.5.0
https://github.com/defold/extension-rive/releases/tag/2.3.0
https://github.com/defold/extension-simpledata/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## Migration:

For a full list of migration notes, [see the PR](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7889)

## dmsdk/dlib/configfile.h

This file now contains both the the C and C++ api.

## dmsdk/extension/extension.h

This file now contains both the the C and C++ api.

* May need to cast from C++ enum to C enum
* May need to cast to correct callback type

## dmsdk/resource/resource.h

This file now contains both the the C and C++ api.

* We've updated the resource system to use pointers to structs in the public callbacks.
* We've moved some structs into opaque handles

__NEW__: ([#8935](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8935)) __Frustrum culling for tilemap__ 
Tilemaps are now included when doing frustum culling in `render.draw()`. Tilemaps are divided into 32x32 tile regions and culling is applied per region, not individual tiles.

__NEW__: ([#8912](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8912)) __Vulkan readpixels support__ 
The vulkan render adapter can now read the framebuffer into a pixel buffer. This is currently only used in recorder extension(s), but the functionality might be available in a user facing api at some point.

__NEW__: ([#29](https://github.com/defold/extension-spine/issues/29)) __Spine Clipping Feature Support__ 
Add support for clipping in spine extension.

__NEW__: ([#8667](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8667)) __dmSDK: Added possibility to load collection proxies and spawn factories from C++__ 
This update adds more functionality to our C++ sdk, which is part of our effort to allow a developer to write the game logic using C++.
It is an ongoing task, and we'll add more functionality along the way.

__NEW__: ([#8932](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8932)) __Make the ASCII character set optional in fonts__ 
The `Extra Characters` field has been deprecated and replaced with a new field called `Characters`. This new field combines the default ASCII with any previously defined `Extra Characters`. Using this new field, developers can specify exactly which symbols the font should include, e.g. numbers only, etc.

__NEW__: ([#8348](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8348)) __Migrate OSX to GLFW3+__ 
We have removed our old modified GLFW version on OSX in favour of the latest publicly released GLFW 3.4 version. This will enable us to improve our desktop feature set, as well as help fix many legacy OS issues across the board. When we consider that this work is stable enough on OSX, the rest of the desktop platforms will get updated as well.

__NEW__: ([#9021](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9021)) __Add option to build script that generates compile_commands.json file(s)__ 
Adds a new `--generate-compile-commands` option to `build.py` that generates `compile_commands.json` files per engine lib/sub project and concatenates them into one "global" json that is written to the root.



Before (using ECC, but without compile_commands.json):

After:

__NEW__: ([#9047](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9047)) __Change sprite image by sampler hash__ 
Scripts can now change a sprite image by using a sampler hash:
`go.set("#sprite", "image", self.my_atlas_mask, { key = sampler_name })`

Or get the atlas from a specific sampler:
`go.get("#sprite", "image", { key = sampler_name })`

For example, this sprite is using a material that has two samplers, `tex0` and `tex1`:
<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/defold/defold/assets/169640/094c3064-090d-4fae-90e4-d8d6f79aa4d1">

To change the second atlas, pass "tex1" in as the key in the `go.set` call:
`go.set("/go1#sprite", "image", my_tex1_atlas, { key = "tex1" })`

To retrieve the atlas of the sampler, call:
`local my_tex1_atlas = go.get("/go1#sprite", "image", { key = "tex1" })`

__NEW__: ([#9049](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9049)) __Updated to Xcode 15.4, iOS SDK 17.5 and macOS SDK 14.5__ 


__NEW__: ([#9060](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9060)) __Concat errors when creating shaders in runtime__ 
Shader errors now include the name of the shader and a concatenated error string when the graphics driver is unable to create it.

__NEW__: ([#8975](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8975)) __Compute shader support part 3__ 
We have released a technical preview of the next iteration of the `compute shader `support in Defold. Compute shaders are a general purpose shader program that can be used for any type of game related tasks on the GPU. Although you can use it for rendering as well, compute shaders are typically used for things like updating rigged animation, particle systems, ray marching and so on. 

A compute program is similar to a Material - you can specify constants and samplers in the resource itself, as well as use certain render api functions to bind textures and constants. However, there is no logical connection to a game object, everything related to a compute program happens in a render script and there is no editor preview.

**Please note!**
since we consider this to be a a technical preview, things might change between versions in case we need to make significant changes to the source formats and engine functionality. Please help us improve this feature by testing it out and report any bugs you might encounter!

__FIX__: ([#376](https://github.com/defold/extender/pull/376)) __Unescape gcc defines before use__ 
The `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS` of a Podspec may contain escaped strings. These need to be unescaped before use. Example:

https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Specs/1/7/a/AppMetricaPlatform/5.3.1/AppMetricaPlatform.podspec.json#L23

__FIX__: ([#380](https://github.com/defold/extender/pull/380)) __Improved Info.plist merge handling__ 
This change improves how `<array>` entries are merged. An array key can now specify a `keep` merge strategy, to keep existing values as-is and add new values to the array. If the array has the `merge` merge strategy (the default), any values in the array will be merged (more specifically `<dict>` values).

Example with the default `merge` strategy:

```lua
A:
<key>My Array</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>Foobar</key>
		<array>
			<string>a</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>

B:
<key>My Array</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>Foobar</key>
		<array>
			<string>b</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>

MERGED:
<key>My Array</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>Foobar</key>
		<array>
			<string>a</string>
			<string>b</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>
```

Same example with the `keep` merge strategy:

```lua
A:
<key merge='keep'>My Array</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>Foobar</key>
		<array>
			<string>a</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>

B:
<key>My Array</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>Foobar</key>
		<array>
			<string>b</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>

MERGED:
<key>My Array</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>Foobar</key>
		<array>
			<string>a</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
	<dict>
		<key>Foobar</key>
		<array>
			<string>b</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>
```

__FIX__: ([#8871](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8871)) __Support tangent space handedness__ 
Tangents are now produced as vec4 in the engine, where the fourth component is the handedness of the tangent vector. This can then be used to calculate the correct tangent space vectors in a shader:

`vec3 bitangent = cross(normal, tangent.xyz * tangent.w);`

__FIX__: ([#8987](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8987)) __Fixed the issue where the Tilemap was not using flip and rotate attributes for physics__ 
Fixed the issue where tile rotation and flip were applied for the visualization of the tile but not for physics.

__FIX__: ([#8945](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8945)) __Use resource pointers all the way for GUI textures__ 


__FIX__: ([#8972](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8972)) __Fix crash in GUI when atlas changes texture resource internally__ 
Fixed a crash where a call to resource.set_atlas(...) replaces the texture that was backing an atlas used in a GUI with a new texture resource. In this case, the engine was using the old texture resource pointer that was originally used in the atlas, whereas now we resolve the actual pointer being used instead.

__FIX__: ([#8918](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8918)) __Fixed triggers and back button for controllers on macOS__ 
Fixed an issue when triggers and back button on macOS weren't caught by the gamepads input system.

__FIX__: ([#26](https://github.com/defold/extension-ironsource/pull/26)) __AdQuality SDK__ 
The extension now supports the [IronSource Ad Quality SDK](https://www.is.com/adquality/) which can be used to review the ads that are served to your users and report problematic content, ad network quality issues and measure how your ads perform.

The Ad Quality SDK will be initialized together with the IronSource SDK when calling `ironsource.init()`.

Fixes #20

__FIX__: ([#382](https://github.com/defold/extender/issues/382)) __Include shared objects from an .aar file into Android builds__ 
Some .aar fils contain a jni folder with .so files. This task should make sure to find these files and send them back to the client for bundling.

https://github.com/ironsource-mobile/android-adqualitysdk/tree/main/com/ironsource/adqualitysdk/7.16.0

__FIX__: ([#8956](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8956)) __Added Android bundler option to extract native libs on install__ 
The Android bundler will now respect the `android:extractNativeLibs` attribute on the application level in AndroidManifest.xml. The option is configurable from `game.project` in the Android section.

This attribute indicates whether the package installer extracts native libraries from the APK to the file system. If set to "false", your native libraries are stored uncompressed in the APK. Although your APK might be larger, your application loads faster because the libraries load directly from the APK at runtime.

### IMPORTANT
If you are using a custom AndroidManifest.xml and would like to use this new option please make sure to add the `android:extractNativeLibs` attribute to the `<application>` tag:

```lua
<application
        android:extractNativeLibs="{{android.extract_native_libs}}"
```

__FIX__: ([#8994](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8994)) __Fixed APK installation on device after bundling.__

__FIX__: ([#9002](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9002)) __Multi-touch improvements for Android devices__ 
Fixed an issue where multi-touch on Android caused some events to not be processed, leading to "ghost" input events that gets dispatched to the `on_input` function forever.

__FIX__: ([#9062](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9062)) __Delete dynamic attributes from sprites when deleting the instance__ 
Fixed an issue where dynamically allocated vertex attributes were not correctly released from sprite components when the sprite component has been deleted.

The editor now has support for copy/paste/cut of all resources nodes in the outline view except for "layouts". Layouts are unique and only one of each type can exist in a GUI at any time.

__NEW__: ([#9059](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9059)) __Allow disabling globals linting__ 
It's now possible to set or disable globals linting in `.luacheckrc`, e.g.:
```lua

```

__NEW__: ([#9055](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9055)) __Add imperative editor script API__ 
This changeset adds imperative editor script APIs:
1. `editor.transact(txs)`: similar to [`"set"` action](https://defold.com/manuals/editor-scripts/#undoable-actions) — modify the editor's in-memory state.
2. `editor.execute(cmd...)`: similar to [`"shell"` action](https://defold.com/manuals/editor-scripts/#non-undoable-actions) — execute a shell script.
3. `editor.save()`: persist all unsaved changes to disk.

__FIX__: ([#8951](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8951)) __Make sure user uses only one shape type in a Collision Object__

__FIX__: ([#8984](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8984)) __Fixed the issue where "Frame Selection" (F) doesn't work on multipage atlas.__ 
Fixed the issue where "Frame Selection" (F) doesn't work on a multipage atlas if an image is selected on any page except the first one.

__FIX__: ([#8934](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8934)) __Bring back update download progress__

Sanitize the project folder path to remove all prohibited symbols used in the project title when creating a new project in the Welcome screen.

__FIX__: ([#8958](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8958)) __Improve suggested completions__ 
This changeset does not show "lower quality" completions (text) when the "higher quality" completions are present (e.g. method, variable, etc.).

__FIX__: ([#8959](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8959)) __Don't suggest completion popup unnecessarily__ 
The editor no longer shows the completion popup after typing `{` and `,`.

__FIX__: ([#9022](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9022)) __Refactor editor scripts runtime__ 
We want to expand the editor scripting capabilities in the future, so we refactored the editor script Lua runtime to be more efficient when it comes to runtime-editor interactions, and to be more user-friendly. One noticeable change in editor script behavior is automatic reload of resources after `file:write(...); file:close()` calls while the editor script is running. This means that using `editor.get(my_resource_path, "text")` after writing to a file identified by `my_resource_path` will now return the updated text.

__FIX__: ([#9042](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9042)) __Make sure that recursion is impossible when pasting a folder into its subfolders.__ 
Show an error if the user tries to paste a folder into its subfolders.

__FIX__: ([#9030](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9030)) __Show an error if the wrong script type is used__ 
Fixed the issue where neither the editor nor bob reacts when the wrong script type is used, such as a `.script` file instead of a `*.gui_script` in `*.gui` etc.
