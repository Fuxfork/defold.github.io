title: Defold development for PlayStation®4
brief: This manual describes how to get PlayStation®4 access
---

# Development for PlayStation®4 console 
Due to licensing restrictions, access to Defold versions with support for game development on PS4™ is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with PS4™ game development support you need to be registered as a licensed PS4™ game developer.

<div class='sidenote' markdown='1'>
Defold currently only provides support for the PS4™ console. Games made for PlayStation®4 will also run on PlayStation®5 in compatibility mode. Official PS5 console support will be available later this year.

## Registering as developer for PS4™ game development
You can register as a game developer for PS4™ game development from the [PlayStation™ Partners page](https://register.playstation.net/partnership)

When you have been approved by Sony you will get access to the Playstation®4 DevNet. Navigate to Development > Tools & Middleware > Tools & Middleware directory > Defold. Click the 'Confirm Status' button.

## PS4™ access in Defold 
Once we have received confirmation of your status as a licensed developer for PS4™ we offer two tiers of access in Defold:

* Standard access - PS4™ extension, build tools and support.
* Source code access - PS4™ extension, build tools and support AND source code access to the PS4™ specific parts of the Defold engine.

## Standard access 
Access to versions of Defold with PS4™ game development support is provided free of charge to all developers licensed on PS4™. As a licensed developer we will provide you with access to:

* Extension with PS4™ specific API integrations.
* Command line tool with support for building to the PS4™ console.
* Forum where you are able to get PS4™ specific support.

## Source code access 
Source code access is only provided to approved PS4™ developers with [active monthly community donation](/community-donations/) for an amount which gives you source code access.
